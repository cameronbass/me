        Blackhawk Network provides Gift Cards, Prepaid Incentive Cards & More for Employers and Merchants
      </p>

      <p>
        At Blackhawk, I was able to put on my front-end hat exclusively. I worked on giftcards.com and helped with a significant redesign that resulted in experience with WordPress, React, and Angular.
      </p>

      <p>
        My time at Blackhawk network was relatively short, but having the experience of solely working on the front-end leveled up my skills in ways I did not expect when I started.
