        I had the great fortune of starting my career at Collective Idea as an intern. This experience exposed me to many different problems and allowed my skills to develop on both the front-end and back-end of web development. After one year of internship at Collective Idea, they hired me to be a full-time developer on the team.

        Over my five years at Collective Idea, I worked for many companies, from small startups to Fortune 500 businesses. The time I spent at Collective Idea will always be a fond memory and a learning experience like none other.
